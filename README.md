# JabRef

JabRef is a graphical application for managing bibliographical data.

* Homepage: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/
* Development page: https://github.com/JabRef
* Main git repository: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref

This repository has been generated out of the old git repository at sourceforge.
The folder  `jabref` of the old repository is now this repositry.
Although that changed **all** git commit ids, the advantage is to have a clean separation between plugins, the homepage and the code of JabRef.

## Next Steps

Change build system from `ant` to `gradle` to get rid of the binaries in the repository.
