Abstract
  Objectives: To assess the correct positioning of iliosacral screw in patients with unstable traumatic pelvic ring injury by comparing fluoroscopically guided computer-navigated surgery (CNS) with conventional fluoroscopy (CF) through reviewing post-operative CT scans and clinical indicators.

  Design: A comparative multicenter cohort study.

  Setting: Two level I Trauma Centers in The Netherlands.

  Patients: The computer-navigated group (n=56) and the conventional fluoroscopy group (n=24) were comparable regarding age (mean, 43 yr), gender (58%, male), BMI (25 kg/m2), ISS (27), injury-to-surgery interval (7 days) and OTA classification (40% 61-B, 60% 61-C).

  Main Outcome Measurements: The position of the iliosacral screws was evaluated on postoperative CT scans. Additionally, clinical morbidity and re-operation were assessed.

  Results: In the CNS group, a total of 111 screws were placed (2.0 per patient), of which 83% were placed correctly. In the CF group, 39 screws (1.6 per patient) were placed, 82% of them correctly.

  Inadequate fixation included neural foramina hit (12 screws (11%) in the CNS group vs. 3 screws (8%) in the CF group, p = 0.76) and extra osseous dislocation (7 screws (6%) vs. 4 screws (10%), respectively, p = 0.47). Five patients required re-operation, all in the computer-navigated surgery group, p = 0.32. We observed more adequate positioning with increased surgical experience, p = 0.12.

  Conclusions: In contrast to what has been suggested by previous studies, we found no benefit from computer-navigated iliosacral screw fixation compared to fluoroscopically guided surgery regarding the correct positioning of iliosacral screw on postoperative CT scans and related morbidity.

  Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

Abstract
  : The purpose of the study was to compare the use of a Computer Adaptive Test and Curriculum-Based Measurement in the assessment of mathematics. This study also investigated the degree to which slope or rate of change predicted student outcomes on the annual state assessment of mathematics above and beyond scores of single point screening assessments (i.e., the computer adaptive test or the CBM assessment just before the administration of the state assessment). Repeated measurement of mathematics once per month across a 7-month period using a Computer Adaptive Test (STAR-Math) and Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM, AIMSweb Math Computation, AIMSweb Math Concepts/Applications) was collected for a maximum total of 250 third, fourth, and fifth grade students. Results showed STAR-Math in all 3 grades and AIMSweb Math Concepts/Applications in the third and fifth grades had primarily linear growth patterns in mathematics. AIMSweb Math Computation in all grades and AIMSweb Math Concepts/Applications in Grade 4 had decelerating positive trends. Predictive validity evidence showed the strongest relationships were between STAR-Math and outcomes for third and fourth grade students. The blockwise multiple regression by grade revealed that slopes accounted for only a very small proportion of additional variance above and beyond what was explained by the scores obtained on a single point of assessment just prior to the administration of the state assessment.
