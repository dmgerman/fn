An allocation rule is called Bayes-Nash incentive compatible, if 
there exists a payment rule, such that truthful reports of 
agents? types form a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in the 
directrevelation mechanism consisting of the allocation rule and 
the payment rule. This paperprovides characterizations of Bayes-
Nash incentive compatible allocation rules in socialchoice 
settings where agents have one-dimensional or multi-dimensional 
types, quasi-linearutility functions and interdependent 
valuations. The characterizations are derived byconstructing 
complete directed graphs on agents? type spaces with cost of 
manipulationas lengths of edges. Weak monotonicity of the 
allocation rule corresponds to the conditionthat all 2-cycles in 
these graphs have non-negative length.For one-dimensional types 
and agents? valuation functions satisfying non-
decreasingexpected differences, we show that weak monotonicity of 
the allocation rule is a necessaryand sufficient condition for 
the rule to be Bayes-Nash incentive compatibile. In the casewhere 
types are multi-dimensional and the valuation for each outcome is 
a linear functionin the agent?s type, we show that weak 
monotonicity of the allocation rule together withan integrability 
condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for Bayes-Nash 
incentivecompatibility.
