Such a parameter is specified in the layout file  * by the following construct: \format[MyFormatter(argument){\field}  * If and only if MyFormatter is a class that implements ParamLayoutFormatter,  * it will be set up with the argument given in the parenthesis by way of the  * method setArgument(String). If no argument is given, the formatter will be  * invoked without the setArgument() method being called first.  */
