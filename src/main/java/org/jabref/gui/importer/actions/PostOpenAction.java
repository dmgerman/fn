comment|/**  * This interface defines potential actions that may need to be taken after  * opening a BIB file into JabRef. This can for instance be file upgrade actions  * that should be offered due to new features in JabRef, and may depend on e.g.  * which JabRef version the file was last written by.  *  * This interface is introduced in an attempt to add such functionality in a  * flexible manner.  */
