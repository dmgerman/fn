## Understanding the basics
We welcome contributions to JabRef and encourage to create a fork, make a patch, and create a pull request.

Please consider  that

* JabRef 2.11 relies on Java 6 and offers plugin support.
* JabRef 2.11 is discontinued and therefore, the current development in the master branch (see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/) should be followed.
